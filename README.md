# CryptoMentee

Hi, 

Please do consider being a [CryptoMentor](https://github.com/artsy-entrepreneurs/CryptoMentor-CryptoMentee/issues/1) and having me as your CryptoMentee 🙏

By brief introduction, my name is Sumeet, which in Sanskrit means a good (flirty) friend. My filmmaking goal is to help 8 indie artists and entrepreneurs earn an Oscar nomination each, and do so before the end of year 2041 🎯

I arrived at this long-term filmmaking goal after a covid break from software engineering ([link](https://github.com/artsy-entrepreneurs/CryptoMentor-CryptoMentee/issues/1)), many entrepreneurial failures ([link](https://github.com/artsy-entrepreneurs/CryptoMentor-CryptoMentee/issues/1)), struggles with dyslexia and ADHD ([link](https://github.com/artsy-entrepreneurs/CryptoMentor-CryptoMentee/issues/1)), undergoing a difficult-divine journey of finding myself ([link](https://github.com/artsy-entrepreneurs/CryptoMentor-CryptoMentee/issues/1)), and with some much needed help from accidental mentors ([link](https://github.com/artsy-entrepreneurs/CryptoMentor-CryptoMentee/issues/1)).

CryptoMentee is a result of all of that, and is a very focused NFT side-project. It is a 3-way marriage between my Hindu American thought models, my love for coding, and the filmmaking goal of helping indie artists earn Oscar nominations ([link](https://github.com/artsy-entrepreneurs/CryptoMentor-CryptoMentee/issues/1)).

It would be an honor if you join this journey as a [CryptoMentor](https://github.com/artsy-entrepreneurs/CryptoMentor-CryptoMentee/issues/1).

Thanks, Sumeet.

It is also worth mentioning that —

- We are determined to get RODIC released at 1000+ theatre screens across the US and India. And online everywhere.
- We will do this by making RODIC an insanely awesome movie, that is oscar-worthy, music-rich, crypto-powered, surprisingly open-source, and delightfully dark. 
- Traditional studio methods of Hollywood and Bollywood need some serious upgrades. Crypto movement is the sexiest way to attempt doing that.
