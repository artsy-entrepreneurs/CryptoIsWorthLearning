# CryptoMentee

## PERSONAL NOTE

Hi, 

By brief introduction, my name is Sumeet, which in Sanskrit means a good friend. Amongst other things, I am a fulltime software developer ([link](https://github.com/artsy-entrepreneurs/CryptoMentor-CryptoMentee/issues/1)), a frequently-failing-learning entrepreneur ([link](https://github.com/artsy-entrepreneurs/CryptoMentor-CryptoMentee/issues/1)), and a hobbist filmmaker ([link](https://github.com/artsy-entrepreneurs/CryptoMentor-CryptoMentee/issues/1)). This project brings all of those loves together in a uniquely focused manner.

Todo about coding, github, crypto, entrepreneurial efforts and then films.

***My filmmaking purpose is to channel my dyslexia, ADHD, storytelling compulsion, curiosity about the human condition, and love for learning new things, into collaborative art and entrepreneurship.***

**My filmmaking goal is to help 8 artists and entrepreneurs earn an Oscar nomination each, and do so before the end of year 2041 🎯**

I arrived at this focused long-term filmmaking goal after taking a sabatical from software engineering jobs ([link](https://github.com/artsy-entrepreneurs/CryptoMentor-CryptoMentee/issues/1)), failing in many entrepreneurial efforts ([link](https://github.com/artsy-entrepreneurs/CryptoMentor-CryptoMentee/issues/1)), struggling with dyslexia and ADHD ([link](https://github.com/artsy-entrepreneurs/CryptoMentor-CryptoMentee/issues/1)), undergoing a difficult yet divine journey of finding myself ([link](https://github.com/artsy-entrepreneurs/CryptoMentor-CryptoMentee/issues/1)), and with some much needed help from accidental mentors ([link](https://github.com/artsy-entrepreneurs/CryptoMentor-CryptoMentee/issues/1)).

CryptoMentee is a culmination of all of that. 

As you evaluate various links, sections, and videos of this project, you will find that it is a 3-way marriage of todo.

Please do consider being a [CryptoMentor](https://github.com/artsy-entrepreneurs/CryptoMentor-CryptoMentee/issues/1) and having me as your CryptoMentee 🙏

It will be an honor to innovate with you.

Thanks, Sumeet.
